# Wiro AI Browser Extension for Chrome, Edge, Opera, Whale and Brave

Right-click any image, video, audio clip, text or page to run Wiro AI models: make a video, edit or upscale an image, restore a photo, read text aloud, transcribe, translate and more, with the price shown before every run.

Wiro puts its AI models one right-click away. Pick what you want done with an image, a video, an audio clip, selected text or the page, choose a model from the live Wiro catalog, and the result comes back in a panel next to the page. You sign in with your Wiro account, runs are paid from your Wiro wallet, and the panel shows the price before you start.

## What you can do

| Right-click on | Actions |
| --- | --- |
| An image | make a video, edit with a prompt, upscale, restore an old photo, remove the background, blur faces, find objects, make a 3D model, ask about it, extract or translate its text, make a product ad, add effects, make a song from it, make it talk, try clothes on |
| A video | edit with a prompt, upscale, add music, ask about it |
| An audio clip | transcribe it, change the voice |
| Selected text | generate an image or a video, read it aloud, turn it into a song, translate it, summarize it |
| A page | turn it into a video with Wiro Studio, ask about it |

Each action lists the Wiro models made for it, so new models show up without an extension update. Sort them by price, popularity or date and pick one; the panel asks only for what that model needs. Download a result, copy its link, or keep it in the tray for the next step. Your recent runs are listed under History.

## Install

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wiro-ai-tools-for-images/cehkhdmppbnfeahegjjkdhangjelehab), or in Whale from the [Naver Whale Store](https://store.whale.naver.com/detail/elgobhnkemhlhfakdmpijbknhehnkgle). For Firefox, install the [Wiro AI add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/wiro-ai/) from Firefox Add-ons; its code is in [Wiro-Firefox-Extension](https://github.com/wiroai/Wiro-Firefox-Extension). There is more about the extension at [wiro.ai/browser-extension](https://wiro.ai/browser-extension). Links to Microsoft Edge Add-ons and Opera add-ons will be added here when those listings go live.

To build it from source, use Node.js 22 or later:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/wiroai/Wiro-Chromium-Extension.git
cd Wiro-Chromium-Extension
npm install
(cd core && npm install)
npm run build
```

Then open `chrome://extensions` (or `edge://extensions`), turn on Developer mode, choose **Load unpacked** and pick `dist/`.

## Store packages

```bash
npm run build:store
```

This writes one folder and one zip per store under `release/`, without the development key, so each store assigns its own extension ID:

| Package | Store | Browsers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `wiro-chrome-<version>.zip` | [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/wiro-ai-tools-for-images/cehkhdmppbnfeahegjjkdhangjelehab) | Chrome, Brave, Vivaldi, Arc |
| `wiro-edge-<version>.zip` | Microsoft Edge Add-ons | Edge |
| `wiro-opera-<version>.zip` | Opera add-ons | Opera |
| `wiro-whale-<version>.zip` | [Naver Whale Store](https://store.whale.naver.com/detail/elgobhnkemhlhfakdmpijbknhehnkgle) | Whale |

All four come from the same code. Opera has no side panel API, so its package uses Opera's own sidebar (`sidebar_action`), opens the panel as a popup from the toolbar button and in a tab from a right-click, and carries the 45-character name that Opera's store accepts. Any Chromium browser without the side panel API gets the same tab behaviour. The Whale Store does not accept the `identity` permission, so the Whale package opens the panel as a popup from the toolbar button and in a tab from a right-click, and signs in through Wiro's sign-in page in a tab, like the Safari extension.

## How it is built

The shared code (sign-in, MCP client, actions, model gateway, pricing and the panel UI) lives in [Wiro-Extension-Core](https://github.com/wiroai/Wiro-Extension-Core), included here as the `core/` submodule. This repo adds the Chromium parts:

- `src/platform.ts`: storage, the sign-in window (`chrome.identity.launchWebAuthFlow`) and tabs.
- `src/background.ts`: the service worker. It builds the right-click menus and opens the side panel, or a tab where there is no side panel.
- `src/panel.ts`, `public/panel.html`: the panel page.
- `src/callback.ts`: Whale package only. A content script on Wiro's sign-in callback page that hands the result to the background, which finishes the sign-in.
- `manifest.json`: Manifest V3.
- `scripts/build.mjs`: the esbuild build for development and for the store packages. The bundle is not minified.

After a core change: `git -C core pull origin main`, rebuild, and commit the new `core` pointer.

## Sign-in

The extension signs in with a Wiro account through the OAuth 2.1 server at `mcp.wiro.ai`, with PKCE, so no API key is stored in the browser. Its redirect address is `https://<extension-id>.chromiumapp.org/`. A development build carries the public key in `dev-key.txt`, so its ID stays `dgnlhjpdifdkkfglhhiafpedepmhckbn` on every machine. The private key is not in this repo.

The Whale package has no `identity` permission. It opens the sign-in page in a tab, Wiro sends the browser back to `https://wiro.ai/extension/callback`, and the extension finishes the sign-in there.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `contextMenus` | the Wiro entries in the right-click menu |
| `sidePanel` | the panel where a run is set up and its result shows |
| `storage` | the sign-in tokens, the tray, run history and the last model picked per action |
| `identity` | the Wiro sign-in window |

No host permissions and no content scripts: the extension reads only what a right-click hands it (the item's address, the selected text or the page address) and sends it to Wiro when you start a run. The Whale package drops `sidePanel` and `identity`; its only content script runs on Wiro's sign-in callback page. See the [Wiro privacy policy](https://wiro.ai/agreement/privacy-policy).
